The API provided was blocked due to cors policy, thus using corsanywhere to access the data. It might break later on, in case it does, please let me know. I can't fix cors blockage as it can only be handled on backend

If it's not working at your system, please go to http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo and unlock the server access for your local browser

Again iterating, it's impossible for me to solve this error as it can only be solved on backend. The other alternative I've is to have my own server and proxy the requests from there, but as of now, this works so not doing that
